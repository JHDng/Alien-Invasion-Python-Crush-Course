# 👾Alien Invasion [WIP]
## 🚀Introduction
Alien Invasion is a 2D arcade-style game where players control a spaceship to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders. I started working on this project to learn Python and explore game development concepts. Built using Pygame, the game features smooth controls, increasing difficulty, and score tracking, making it a fun and interactive way to enhance my programming skills.
## 💻Requirements

## 📄Instructions
- Arrow keys(left and right): Move the spaceship left or right
- Spacebar: Fire bullets
- Q: Quit the game
## 🕹️Play the game!
